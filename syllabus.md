# CS 3510 Fall 2020 Syllabus

- **Instructors**: Jacob Abernethy (Coda S1221) and Gerandy Brito (Klaus 2111)
- **TAs**: TBA
- **Textbook**: [*Algorithms*](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Sanjoy-Dasgupta/dp/0073523402) by S. Dasgupta, C. Papadimitriou, and U. Vazirani.
  - *Note*: The textbook [*Algorithm Design*](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Jon-Kleinberg/dp/0321295358) by J. Kleinberg and E. Tardos is optional but an excellent reference 

### Topics to be covered

1. Divide and conquer. 
1. Dynamic programming.
1. Graphs algorithms (search on graphs, DFS, BFS, Dikjstra's algorithm, strongly connected components in directed graphs.)
1. NP completeness

We will typically discuss problems in class that are classical examples of the topic we are covering. Students are expected to do problems using similar strategies in homeworks and exams.

### Grade breakdown

The evaluations will consist of 4 homeworks, 3 exams and one final exam. First, your grade will be weighted as follows:
- 30% Homeworks. 
- 10% In-class quizzes
- 15% Each exam. 

After all grades are in and all overall percentage scores for students have been computed using the weights described above, grades
are assigned as follows:
- **A**: 90-100%
- **B**: 80-90%
- **C**: 70-80%
- **D**: 60-70%
- **F**: 0-60%

After this computation you will have the opportunity to decide if you want to keep this grade or you want to do the final exam. In case you choose to do the final, your score in the final will substitute your lowest two exams, if higher (so you can only improve by taking the final).

**Note**: The cutoffs may be adjusted, but only in the downward direction to improve letter grades.  In the event of a curve,
only your final overall percentage grade for the course will be curved. Individual assignments will not be curved.

### Homeworks

There will be four homeworks. You will have a week to complete each. Each homework will have several problems but only some problems will be graded. Homeworks will be the best source of practice for the exams. There will be a grace period to submit a late homework. Late submissions will be penalized with $10\%$ of your score. Only under very special circumstances a homework will be accepted after the grace period. Once grades are released, you will have a week to ask for a regrade, if you consider that your homework was unfairly graded. Please, be considered to your TAs and only do such request if you detect a mistake in your grading. 

### Exams

Each exam will consist of two or three problems. Exams will be held during regular lecture time. The final exam will be cumulative and will be at the date, time and location indicated in the official GT calendar.  

#### Students with Disabilities and/or in need of Special Accommodations

Georgia Tech complies with the regulations of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and offers accommodations to students with disabilities. If you are in need of classroom or testing accommodations, please make an appointment with the Office of Disability Services to discuss the appropriate procedures.
